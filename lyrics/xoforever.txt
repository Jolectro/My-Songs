VERSE ONE

You don't understand
When i think all i feel
Is you
You don't understand
When i sleep all i see
Is You

Yea i never will betray
You'll never get to say
This was a stupid mistake
Coz my love will never ever fail

Yea I'll always be the same
You will always be my dame
And we'll always be okay
Coz my heart will never ever change

CHORUS

XO Forever
(XOXO till forever)
Come with me let's be together
(XOXO till forever)
You never feel so better
(XOXO till forever)
I will never leave you never X2

VERSE TWO

They don't understand
Why we seem never weak
My love
They don't understand
That our dream is Unique
My World

Yea They'll never understand
Why we'll never ever lack
Anything you'll ever ask
Coz my love will never ever slack

Yea they'll always get to see
How we're always ever glee
How you're always loving me
Coz we're always living like a team

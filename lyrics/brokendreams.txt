Broken Dreams
 29-11-2022
 Broken dreams Made the future so bleak
 Despicable feels Inexcusable me
 Oh I wish! Yeah I'm tired of it...
 Drowning me! Can I ever be free?
 I'm putting up a fight, Hope I win against my mind
 The thoughts that comes at night, Makes me feel so lost in side
 I'm tryna beat the lies, But I'm running outta time
 I'm someday gonna fly, If only I could just try
 They said believe... You're so close now
 They said have faith... Where's my trust now?
 I wanna hope... I don't know how
 I feel so cold... and alone now
 Golden beams Of the future begins
 The moment I see Why I shouldn't give in
 So I give everything to be free
 I know that someday I'll be more than I dreamed
 I'm conquering my quest As I'm forging to the end
 I'm not here to impress But I'm gonna be my best
 So I'm never gonna fear Coz I'm super undeterred
 I never will relent Till I'm sure I passed the test 
 They said believe... You're so close now
 They said have faith... I've got more now
 I wanna show... I've got hope now
 And yeah I know... I'm not alone now
 When you hear my name, Know this ain't a fairytale now
 Oh yeah serenade, You can keep the accolades now
 When I walk the stage, Know I rose through all the pain now
 Like a Nightingale, I am gonna Ricochet now
 I don't wanna [fade] X6
 I wanna be [great] X6
 I don't wanna [fade] X6
 I wanna be [great] X6
 They said believe... You're so close now
 They said have faith... I've got more now
I wanna show... I've got hope now
 And yeah I know... I'm not alone now
 When you hear my name, Know this ain't a fairytale now
 Oh yeah serenade, You can keep the accolades now
 When I walk the stage, Know I rose through all the pain now
 Like a Nightingale, I am gonna Ricochet now
 It's Jolectroo
